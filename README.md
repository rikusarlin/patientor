# Patientor - frontend

This it "patientor" frontend project for University of Helsinki "Fullstack open 2021" course part 9.

The backend is in another repo (fullstack/osa9/patienttor-backend). You need to run that first ("npm run dev" or something) in order for this frontend to work properly.

The frontend utilizes various React techiques, such as
* React Hooks (useContext, useReducer)
* Formik
* Axios backend connectivity

The frontend is written in  Typescript. In fact, this part 9 of the course is all about Typescript, and this exercise is about applying Typescript in React front ends.
